            Educational Life </h2>
            <p>Ni-Ki, born Nishimura Riki on December 9, 2005, in Okayama, Japan, attended Okayama Shiritsu Kibi Junior High School. In his second year of middle school, he moved to South Korea to pursue his career in the entertainment industry. Due to his early debut with ENHYPEN and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Ni-Ki faced difficulties continuing his formal education. Specifically, enrolling in a Japanese high school required passing an exam in person, which was not feasible during the pandemic. Consequently, he was unable to enroll in a traditional high school program.​
